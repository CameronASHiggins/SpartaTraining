# JPA & Hibernate

To understand JPA and Hibernate you must first understand ORM, Object-Relational Mapping.
ORM is the process of converting Java objections to database tables.
In other words it allows us to interact with a relational database without any SQL.

JPA stands for Java Persistence API, and it is a specification that defines how to persist data in Java applications.
The primary focus of JPA is the ORM layer.

Technically it is now called the Jakarta Persistence API due to changes in naming conventions but it is still the same thing.

**Hibernate** is one of the most popular Java ORM frameworks in use today. Hibernate is a standard implementation of the JPA specification, with a few additional features that are specific to Hibernate.


 ## JPA is the specification - Hibernate is an implementation

Other implementations exist, like EclipseLink, DataNucleus and more.
