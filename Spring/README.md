# What is Spring?

Spring is a way to make programming Java quicker, easier and safer for everybody. Spring focuses on speed, simplicity and productivity, which has made it the world's most popular framework.

The Spring framework is modular by design, allowing developers to choose only the modules they need for their application.

## SpringFramework AKA Spring

This is the foundation for all Spring based projects.

It provides core support for dependency injection, transaction management, web apps, data access, messaging and more.

## Spring Projects

Instead of packaging all utilities into the framework Spring utilities that aren't considered necessary for all types of programs are split into different modules (projects).
