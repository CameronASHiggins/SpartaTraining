## What is a design pattern?
- A design pattern is an accepted solution for a common problem
- Each pattern is a template that can be customised to suit the unique problem you're faced with.

### Aggregation/composition is the key principle behind many design patterns.

#### Aggregation:
- Utilises a CONTAINS-A relationship
- Object A contains objects B; B can live without A.

#### Composition:
- Utilises a HAS-A relationship
- Object A consists of objects B; A manages life cycle of B; B canâ€™t live without A.

### The 3 types of design patterns:

| Creational Design Patterns | Structural Design Patterns | Behavioural Design Patterns |
|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------------:|
|          Factory           |          Adapter           |   Chain of responsibility   |
|      Abstract Factory      |           Bridge           |           Command           |
|          Builder           |         Composite          |         Interpreter         |
|         Singleton          |         Decorator          |          Iterator           |
|        Object Pool         |           Facade           |          Mediator           |
|         Prototype          |         Flyweight          |           Memento           |
|            ---             |     Private Class Data     |         Null Object         |
|            ---             |           Proxy            |          Observer           |
|            ---             |            ---             |            State            |
|            ---             |            ---             |          Strategy           |
|            ---             |            ---             |       Template Method       |
|            ---             |            ---             |           Visitor           |


#### - Creational patterns
  - These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
  - All about class instantiation or object creation
    - Can be further categorised into Class-creational patterns and object creational patterns

#### - Structural patterns
  - These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
  - Allows us to add new functionalities and abilities without affecting their existing behaviour.
  - All about organising different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality.
#### - Behavioral patterns 
  - These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
  - All about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realising these patterns.

## Important patterns
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory Method
- Singleton
- Decorator
- Facade

### Factory/Factory Method
- **Creational design pattern** that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- Loose coupling can be achieved using factory, which is what allows for the creation of SIMILAR kinds of objects.
- Creates objects of several related classes without specifying the exact object to be created.
- Lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

### Abstract Factory
- **Creational design pattern** that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- Creates families of related dependent objects.
- Considered an abstraction of the factory pattern.

### Singleton
- **Creational design pattern** (to be used in how we create objects).
- Lets you ensure that a class has only one instance while providing global access for this instance.
- Store the instance in a variable and use the variable like a getter method, also protects this instance by stopping the new keyword.
- Common use case - Creating a single database connection instead of multiple connections.
#### - Key features of singleton
  - Private Static reference to the object
  - Private constructor
  - Static getter with if statement

### Decorator
- **Structural design pattern**
- Sometimes called the wrapper pattern

### Facade
- **Structural design pattern** that provides a simplified library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.
