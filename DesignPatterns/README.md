## What is a design pattern?
- A design pattern is an accepted solution for a common problem
- Each pattern is a template that can be customised to suit the unique problem you're faced with.

### Aggregation/composition is the key principle behind many design patterns.

#### Aggregation:
- Utilises a CONTAINS-A relationship
- Object A contains objects B; B can live without A.

#### Composition:
- Utilises a HAS-A relationship
- Object A consists of objects B; A manages life cycle of B; B canâ€™t live without A.

### The 3 types of design patterns:

#### - Creational patterns
  - These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
#### - Structural patterns
  - These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
  - Allows us to add new functionalities and abilities without affecting their existing behaviour.
#### - Behavioral patterns 
  - These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
