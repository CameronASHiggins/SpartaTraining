## What is an Object?
- An Object is an instance of a class.
- They contain data in the form of properties and methods.

## What are the 4 principles of OOP?
- Abstraction.
- Encapsulation.
- Inheritance.
- Polymorphism.

### Abstraction
- Is basically only showing the necessary details to the user of the object.
- i.e. Hiding away implementation details inside something.

### Encapsulation
- Is basically binding together fields and methods that manipulate your data and that keep both safes from outside interference and misuse.
- Built on the idea of data hiding
  - Data hiding - where we restrict access to certain properties or methods of an object to whatever is calling the object.
- Encapsulate a class using private properties - with getter and setter methods for accessing these private properties

### Inheritance
- Allows you to have code reusability.
- They let one object acquire the properties and methods of another object.
- Inheritance has an "IS A" relationship
  - subclass IS A super class
  - Ford Focus IS A Car

### Polymorphism
- poly = many, morph = forms
- Polymorphism is the ability of a class to run a method in 2 or more different ways // Enabled through inheritance

### Overloaded Methods
- This is where the same method is used but with different implementations.
  - This can be done with making the same method but with different parameters/arguments.
  - **If the return type is different for a single method then it DOESN'T fit the category of an overloaded method**
